# Calories Burnt Prediction
   
This project aims to predict the amount of calories burnt during physical activity based on various factors such as the user's gender, height, weight, and the type of activity performed. 
The project uses machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to achieve this goal.

# Prerequisites
 
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
seaborn
sklearn
xgboost
joblib
pickle
opendatasets

 # Data Loading and Reading
 
The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle datasets, and the library opendatasets was used to download the dataset. The data was then loaded into a pandas dataframe, and the information about the dataset was extracted using various pandas methods.

 # Data Visualization
 
Various visualization techniques were used to get an understanding of the data and the relationships between the different columns. Some of the techniques used include violin plots, box plots, histograms, and kernel density plots.

 # Algorithm Selection
 
Multiple machine learning algorithms were used to predict the calories burnt. Some of the algorithms used include Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, and XGBoost Regressor.

 # Model Evaluation
 
The performance of the different algorithms was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and mean squared error. The algorithm that performed best was then selected and saved as a pickle file for future use.

 # Note
 
The code is automatically generated by Colaboratory, and the original file can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z-u07g01rFezvTarBOJb1I8F7T-jAngM.
